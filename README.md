# A Turnkey Mobile VP Studio by Antilatency

Antilatency is launching a new product — a professional virtual production studio, ready to use out of the box with minimal setup. Designed for rapid deployment, the studio requires no more than **2 days from delivery to first shoot**.

The main goal of the project is to **lower the entry barrier** to virtual production while delivering **exceptional out-of-the-box quality**.

Here’s the set of elements that makes this possible.

## Mechanical Design
The client will receive structural elements for assembling a 6×6×4.5 meter studio, including:
- Custom-designed flat aluminum trusses
- Two sets of chroma key fabric backdrops for uninterrupted operation (no waiting for cleaning)
- Blackout fabric for the exterior shell

## Next-Gen Light fixtures

## Built-In Antilatency Tracking
Integrated with our brand-new **TrackedVideo technology** — a breakthrough in tracking data synchronization.

TrackedVideo encodes tracking data directly into the camera’s audio line-in. This ensures perfect sync with the video feed at all times, regardless of transmission pipeline delay.

- Seamlessly record or live-stream tracking + video

- Compatible with HDMI, SDI, and even wireless extension systems

- Easily archive or **post-process** thanks to embedded tracking data


## Optimized Lighting Layout

The studio comes with a **pre-engineered lighting layout**, designed through simulations.
This ensures optimal light distribution and uniform chroma key illumination — from day one.
